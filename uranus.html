                <p class="intro">
                   Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the Greek god of the sky, Uranus, who, according to Greek mythology, was the grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter) and father of Cronus (Saturn). It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System.

                    Uranus is known as the “sideways planet” because it rotates on its side.Uranus was the first planet found using a telescope.
